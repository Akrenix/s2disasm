A disassembly of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.

To build this, use build.bat if you're a Windows user, or build.sh otherwise. The built ROM will be called 's2built.bin'.

If you're a non-Windows user, you'll have to install the AS Macro Assembler ('http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as'). This disassembly targets a modified version of AS 1.42 Beta Build 204, whose source code can be found at 'https://github.com/flamewing/asl-releases'.

Non-Windows users will also need to install GCC's C compiler, as the rest of the build tools are compiled from source when build.sh is first ran.
